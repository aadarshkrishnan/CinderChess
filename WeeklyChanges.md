Code mod mentioned that previously students would create a new md file that would explain weekly changes so I decided to do so rather than a pull request since I do not have multiple branches split by weeks.

Week 1 Changes:

- Created piece interface and full implementation of all movement for all pieces except the pawn's "en passant" feature that will require wider scope
- Created board class (Has only getter functionality now)
- Created app class that updates (Only has method declarations now)
- Created test files (currently empty)
- Created working CMake designed similarly to ideal gas
