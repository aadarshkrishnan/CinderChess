Project Proposal

  The project I want to do is a dynamic chess game_board_ that hopefully will be able to save a file of a notated game, play two player games (I would try one player, but creating a chess computer is something that feels out of scope right now), and the ability to restart a game at any time. It will be like a mini chess application.
  I’ve been playing chess since I was six, and I still play almost every day online today. Not finishing this project would be a complete disappointment to myself, so it’s something that I have to see all the way through. It’s something I love and making it all work together would be something I’m proud of. 
  

By the end of week 1 I would like to have the game, board, and pieces classes made. 

By week 2 I would like to have the game_board_ piece interaction working. I would like all the pieces to work with the game_board_ essentially finishing the game_board_ interactions. 

By the end of week 3 I would like to have all testing and all edge cases and turn based movement complete. Essentially a working turn by turn chess game that does not allow illegal moves.

I finish early, I will try to implement a “crazy house” version where the back rank on both sides is jumbled so the initial start position is different. It’ll probably be a little more work, but there’s so many variations of chess that I could keep adding something. I could add a clock. I could add loser chess. Possibilities are endless.
