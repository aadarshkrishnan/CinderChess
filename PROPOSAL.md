Project Proposal

  The project I want to do is a dynamic chess board_ that hopefully will be able to save a file of a notated game, play two player games (I would try one player, but creating a chess computer is something that feels out of scope right now), and the ability to restart a game at any time. It will be like a mini chess application.
  I’ve been playing chess since I was six, and I still play almost every day online today. Not finishing this project would be a complete disappointment to myself, so it’s something that I have to see all the way through. It’s something I love and making it all work together would be something I’m proud of. 
  By the end of week 1 I would like to have the board_ and pieces class made. By week 2 I would like to have the board_ piece interaction working. I would like all the pieces to work with the board_ essentially finishing the board_ interactions. By the end of week 3 I would like to implement the save file and restart game. The extra parts to the application. 
  If I finish early, I will try to implement a “crazy house” version where the back rank on both sides is jumbled so the initial start position is different. It’ll probably be a little more work, but there’s so many variations of chess that I could keep adding something. I could add a clock. I could add loser chess. Possibilities are endless.
